## üìñ Project Overview

**BeChat** is a Bluetooth-based chat application that enables seamless communication between Android devices without requiring an internet connection. The app leverages Android's native Bluetooth capabilities to discover nearby devices, establish secure connections, and facilitate real-time text message exchange between users.

Whether you're in a remote area without network coverage or simply want a private, direct communication channel with nearby friends, BeChat provides a reliable peer-to-peer messaging solution powered by modern Android development practices.

## üìù How to Run

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** (Arctic Fox or newer)
- **Android SDK** (API level 21 or higher)
- **Physical Android device** (Bluetooth functionality requires physical hardware)
- **Bluetooth support** on test devices

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BeChat.git
   cd BeChat
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio
   - Select "Open an Existing Project"
   - Navigate to the cloned `BeChat` directory
   - Click "OK" to open the project

3. **Sync Dependencies**
   - Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle dependencies
   - Wait for the sync process to complete

4. **Build the Project**
   - Select "Build" ‚Üí "Make Project" or press `Ctrl+F9` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+F9` (Mac)
   - Ensure there are no build errors

5. **Deploy to Physical Device**
   ```bash
   # Enable Developer Options and USB Debugging on your Android device
   # Connect device via USB cable
   # Run the app
   ```
   - Click "Run" ‚Üí "Run 'app'" or press `Shift+F10`
   - Select your connected physical device
   - Wait for app installation and launch

6. **Test Bluetooth Chat**
   - **Grant Permissions**: Allow Bluetooth and Location permissions when prompted
   - **Enable Bluetooth**: Turn on Bluetooth if disabled
   - **Test with Two Devices**: Install the app on two different devices for full testing
   - **Start Chat**: One device acts as server, the other connects as client

### üìã Testing Checklist
- [ ] App installs successfully on physical device
- [ ] Bluetooth permissions are granted
- [ ] Location permissions are granted
- [ ] Bluetooth can be enabled through the app
- [ ] Device discovery works
- [ ] Connection establishment succeeds
- [ ] Messages are sent and received in real-time
